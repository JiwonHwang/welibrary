#WELIBRARY
I made this project during winter code camp(Feb-Jan 2016) by django girls seoul, coding study community for women. 

# Purpose
To share info for django girls seoul memebers and anyone who is interested in learning python, django to build web application. 
We shared resources in slack, but had to search to find it again. I needed it for myself to save and organize it. Hopefully can be useful for other dango girls and whoever interested in making web application using python and django.
